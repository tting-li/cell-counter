Q1 b: Which cell populations are significantly different in relative frequencies between responders and non-responders? Please include statistics to support your conclusion.

Using the mann-whitney U test, it can be found that B cells, CD4 T cells, and Monocytes are significantly different in their frequency values for responders and non-responders as the p values for these cell populations show less than 0.05 more than the other. The box plots also visually demonstrate the same conclusion where it can be seen the y and n responses for each cell population are significally different are one another except for CD8 T cells and the nk cells.
